<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>
I was born in Portsmouth, VA and moved to Washington state just before my 5th birthday as part of a Navy
family.  I later moved to Seattle in 1999 to live with my sister and eventually moved out on my own.  I currently 
work in the court system, but I am actively pursuing other career and job options.  In my spare time, I enjoy
training in mixed martial arts and have done so for the last 10 years and also crossfit for the last year.
